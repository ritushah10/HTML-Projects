		<font color="#FFFF00">Hello! My name is Ritu Shah!</font> <font color="FFFFFF">I am in 11th grade and I attend Herricks High School. My favorite colors are dark blue and dusty rose. I have an older sister named Ruby who is 23 years old. My favorite restaurant is Max Brenner which is in New York City. I also have a pet guinea pig named Munchkin. My parents decided to get me a pet because I got into Math Honors in 6th grade and they were very proud of me. Currently, I am taking AP Calculus AB and it really is a struggle. However, I am motivated and determined to do well in school.</font>

		<font color="#00FF00">I have many interests. I have a huge passion for dance since I have been dancing since I was four years old. My mom wanted me to start a type of classical Indian dancing called Kathak. Since she kept pushing me to do it, I was able to graduate after 13 years of doing it. Even though I graduated, I have not given up dancing. In my high school, we have a club called Dance Theatre Club. I have been part of the club for the past 3 years and performed in each dance show. Because of this club, I have had an interest in hip-hop which has lead me to do many dance events in school.</font>
